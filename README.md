ASP.NET MVC4 Example of a Single Page App to share source with PhoneGap Apps.


Description
---------------------------------

This project is simply an ASP.NET MVC4 example of a website that is implmented as a Single Page Application (SPA). The purpose of the project is to allow for the SPA to be used as the source for device apps using PhoneGap. The ASP.NET MVC4 framework is used mostly to implement an example JSON API that the SPA uses. The SPA is housed in directory called 'site' that allows for easier packaging for build.phonegap.com.
